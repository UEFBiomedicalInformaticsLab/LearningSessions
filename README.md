# MOA1

Students passing the course will be able to describe basic concepts of machine learning, including the main steps that are implemented in a typical Machine Learning project. 

This course includes four practical sessions implemented in Python:

0) Build an end-to-end ML framework
1) Supervised learning: classification
2) Supervised learning: regression
3) Unsupervised learning: dimensionality reduction and clustering
